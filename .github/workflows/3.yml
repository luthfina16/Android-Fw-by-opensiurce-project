# This workflow will build and push a node.js application to an Azure Web App when a commit is pushed to your default branch.
#
# This workflow assumes you have already created the target Azure App Service web app.
# For instructions see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-nodejs?tabs=linux&pivots=development-environment-cli
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Download the Publish Profile for your Azure Web App. You can download this file from the Overview page of your Web App in the Azure Portal.
#    For more information: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-github-actions?tabs=applevel#generate-deployment-credentials
#
# 2. Create a secret in your repository named AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE, paste the publish profile contents as the value of the secret.
#    For instructions on obtaining the publish profile see: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/deploy-github-actions#configure-the-github-secret
#
# 3. Change the value for the AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME. Optionally, change the AZURE_WEBAPP_PACKAGE_PATH and NODE_VERSION environment variables below.

        # This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# This workflow locates REST API file contracts (Swagger or OpenAPI format, v2 and v3, JSON and YAML)
# and runs 300+ security checks on them using 42Crunch Security Audit technology to uncover
# potential vulnerabilities related to authentication, authorization as well as data validation.
#
# Documentation is located here: https://docs.42crunch.com/latest/content/tasks/integrate_github_actions.htm
#
# To use this workflow, you need a 42Crunch platform account. If you do not have one, you can contact us
# from this page: https://42crunch.com/request-demo.
#
# 1. Follow steps at https://docs.42crunch.com/latest/content/tasks/integrate_github_actions.htm
#    to create an API Token on the 42Crunch platform
#
# 2. Create an secret in GitHub as explained in https://docs.42crunch.com/latest/content/tasks/integrate_github_actions.htm
#    and store the 42Crunch API Token in that secret. Expected default is API_TOKEN (see the api-token property in the task).
